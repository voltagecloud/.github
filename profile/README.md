## Utilities
- [voltageautounlock](https://github.com/w3irdrobot/voltageautounlock)  
The "voltageautounlock" repository provides an auto-unlock service for Voltage LND nodes. It allows setting up a server to receive webhooks and unlock the node, with deployment options including Fly.io, Railway, Docker, and source. Key environment variables include the Node API URL, webhook secret, and wallet password.

- [zero-conf-lnd](https://github.com/voltagecloud/zero-conf-lnd)  
The "zero-conf-lnd" repository helps accept Zero-Conf channels on LND by running as a daemon and connecting to your LND node. It requires specific protocol flags and is configured using a YAML file.
- [zero-conf-cln](https://github.com/voltagecloud/zero-conf-cln)  
The "zero-conf-cln" repository provides a plugin for selectively allowing zero-conf channels from a peer on CLN (Core Lightning Network). To use it, clone the repository and start lightningd with the plugin enabled, specifying the peer's public key.

## Sample projects using Voltage
- [lnd-example-bot](https://github.com/tee8z/lnd-example-bot)  
The "lnd-example-bot" repository demonstrates how to interact with an LND node's API using Rust. The bot repeatedly calls the node's /getinfo endpoint as a "ping" every 30 seconds. It requires a macaroon with /getinfo permissions and the node's URL.

- [voltage-tipper](https://github.com/austinkelsay/voltage-tipper)  
The "voltage-tipper" repository is a simple Lightning tipping app template built with NextJS and Voltage. It is currently under construction and designed to be deployed with Vercel.
